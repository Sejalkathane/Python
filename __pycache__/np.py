# numpy is fundamental package for scientific computing in python.
# provide a multidimentional array object,various derived objects


# ??????  Array::
        #    1d: [1,2,3,4]
        #    2d : [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8]]


# Advantage of using numpy over python list::
#  -->  consumes less memory
#  --> fast as compared to the pyhton list
#  --> convenient to use   -> when output: then array not give comma in between



# advantage of numpy in python::
# use in ml, mathematical function


import numpy as np

x=np.array([1,2,3,4])
print(x)
